## Project Description

Explora is a web application that allows travellers to hire cars of their choice for ease in transportation in the destination area. 
Clients can view existing cars model, year, fuel consumption, fuel type, transmission, number of seats and if available. 
Clients are allowed to create their own accounts to keep track of their booking history. The accounts can be deleted at any time by them. Data privacy is respected.

Cars are booked according to location and once booked, they cannot be double booked.
